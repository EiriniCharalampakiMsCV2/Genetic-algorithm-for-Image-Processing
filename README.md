# Genetic-algorithm-for-Image-Processing

Approximate a 256x256 JPG Image of Spiderman using a Genetic Algorithm
Software: Matlab
The Challenge: Could the application approximate an image of Spiderman by blending just 32 rectangles of arbitrary position 
and color, using ideas from genetic algorithms?
